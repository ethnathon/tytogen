## Tyto cartridges for AndroMDA ##

This is an unofficial fork of the AndroMDA java, hibernate, jsf and spring cartridges.

#### Disclaimer ####

We're not linked to the AndroMDA team, we just develop some cartridge for their code generator.

We forked the main project because we need a faster development cycle than the main project. We contribute to AndroMDA posting in the forums and with patches, and we hope one day our work will be integrated.

If you need support post on [tytogen forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tyto-generation). We'll be glad to help!
